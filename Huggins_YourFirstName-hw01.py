# Homework Question:
# You are given a list of dictionaries where each dictionary represents a student and their scores
# in different subjects.

# Student Data:
students = [
    {"name": "Alice", "scores": {"Math": 85, "Science": 90, "English": 78}},
    {"name": "Bob", "scores": {"Math": 70, "Science": 88, "English": 82}},
    {"name": "Charlie", "scores": {"Math": 92, "Science": 81, "English": 89}},
    {"name": "David", "scores": {"Math": 60, "Science": 75, "English": 80}}
]
student_average = {}
#Write a Python program that:
# 1. Calculates the average score for each student.
# 2. Stores these averages in a new dictionary where the studentâ€™s name is the key and their average score is the value.
# 3. Prints the names of students whose average score is greater than 80.
# Your task is to calculate the average scores for each student and print the names of students
# whose average score is greater than 80.
#Solution

for i in range(len(students)):
    average = 0
    name = students[i]["name"]

    for grade in students[i]["scores"].values():
        average += grade
    average = (average / len(students[i]["scores"])) 
    student_average[name] = average

for student, grade in student_average.items():
    if grade >= 80:
        print(f"{student.title()} received a(n) {round(grade)}")
